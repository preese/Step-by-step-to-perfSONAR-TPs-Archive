 # Quick Start Guide:
 ## Setting Up perfSONAR Testpoints, Archive, and Grafana Hosts
 
Originally getting a MaDDash site up and running was quite challenging. Andy Lakeâ€™s **MaDDash Quick Install Guide** proved to be very helpful. However, it still left out an essential detail: what exactly should the .json file look like?  While it's thoroughly documented, I didn't want to keep dozens of tabs open in my browser to reference all the details.

With perfSONAR V5, the introduction of Testpoints, Archive and Grafan sites made things more approachable. Still, understanding the .json file structure was a missing piece.

This guide will walk you through setting up a set of virtual machines (VMs) with perfSONAR Testpoint, along with the central Archive and Grafana components. Also provided will be a working .json file for your convenience. 

If you're only interested in the .json file, feel free to grab the _3by3.json__ file and skip the rest.
