## Prerequisites and Install Process

1. **Prerequisites**  
- This guide assumes familiarity with command-line operations, package management, and basic Grafana dashboard creation.
- Familiarity with Cockpit for system configuration and VM management is helpful.
- The guide includes instructions for using Cockpit, but other tools or bare-metal setups can be used as well.
- If you're new to Linux or Cockpit, I suggest checking out the provided [links](../Additional-Resources/Cockpit-link.md).

If you are using bare metal servers for the Testpoints and Archive hosts, the configuration is more direct. You can then use the **_[3by3.json](../3by3.json)_** file to quickly get a working Grafana grid.

If you don't have a pile of hardware available but you'd like to see how the perfSONAR-Grafana tools work together, the rest of this is for you.

2. **System Requirements**  
- A host system- 4 cores, 16GB RAM, and 300GB of available storage.
- The system should have internet access at 1G or more for downloading dependencies.
- Install your preferred, modern, up-to-date OS. (Doesn't have to be on the PS list!)
- Install Cockpit and components (**cockpit-machines**) to manage virtual machines

3. **Overview of the Setup Process**  
Here's a high-level outline of the steps weâ€™ll follow:
- Create a base VM with a supported OS (from the perfSONAR list).
- Clone the base VM to create the Archive and Grafana VM.
- Clone the base VM to create one Testpoint VM. Ensure it's fully configured and tested.
- Clone the known good Testpoint VM two more times, for a total of three Testpoint VMs.
- Verify the system and ensure the Grafana dashboard starts populating.

4. **Set Up the Virtual Machines**  
(**Review the [Network Setup](../Network-Details/Network-spec.md) page for needed details.**)
- Create a "Base" VM on your host machine. The base VM runs a supported OS and 2-4 GB of RAM allocated.  Configure networking for **Direct attachment** in Cockpit, ensuring that each VM can communicate with others on the same host. _This is critical for Testpoints to interact with each other and the Archive and Grafana VM._
- Clone the Base VM to create the Archive/Grafana VM (**archive**).  Increase the allocated RAM to 8GB, configure with the appropriate MAC address and IP using **Direct attachement** status.
- Install the [Archive and Grafana components](../Build-TP-Archive-Grafana-systems/Install-Archive-Grafana.md), leave VM running.
- Clone the Base VM to create a Testpoint VM, configure with the appropriate MAC address and IP using **Direct attachement** status. This will be (**ps01**).
- Once cloned, [install the Testpoint package](../Build-TP-Archive-Grafana-systems/Install-Testpoint.md), poweroff the VM.  
- Clone the Testpoint VM (**ps01**) two more times to create **ps02** and **ps03**.  Ensure each cloned VM is configured with the appropriate MAC address and IP as well as **Direct attachement** status.
- Start all three testpoints now.

When completed, visit the Grafana dashboard at **`https://archive.test.net/grafana/dashboards`**. If everything is set up correctly, you should begin seeing data populate into the dashboard. The latency and RTT grids populate first on the Grafana dashboard.
